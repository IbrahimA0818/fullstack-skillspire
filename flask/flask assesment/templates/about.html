    <H1>Flask is a lightweight Python web framework known for its simplicity and flexibility. It's often used for building web applications, APIs, and microservices. Unlike larger frameworks like Django, Flask is considered a "microframework" because it provides the essentials for web development without forcing a specific structure or set of tools. This allows developers to choose the libraries and tools that best suit their needs. </H1>
